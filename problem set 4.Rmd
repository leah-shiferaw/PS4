```{r}

## Instructions
Replicate the plots below to the best of your ability. Try to match *every* element exactly. Please `echo` all code chunks. The chunks must show every step you took and option you specified to generate the plots. Submit in hard copy by March 6. 


## Senate projections
Forecasters at FiveThirtyEight.com published the plot below in [a piece describing their simulations and predictions](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/52-senators-filibuster/) in advance of the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. 


```{r, out.width="300px", fig.retina=2}
  include_graphics('fivethirtyeight.png')
```

1. Use the `senate_seat_distribution_2022.csv` data to replicate the plot exactly. The *one exception*: ignore the text grob, arrow, and shading about the chance of Democrats winning 50 or 51 seats. You can read more about the data at the [FiveThirtyEight github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/election-forecasts-2022) for their forecast. Your printed plot should be 5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall.


```{r}

### Basic histogram of seatprob_Dparty

df = read.csv('senate_seat_distribution_2022.csv')

FctWhen = function(...){
  args = rlang::list2
  cases = case_when(!!!args)
  exect(fct_relevel, cases, !!!rhs)
}



seatprob_Dparty <- c(50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62)

hist(seatprob_Dparty, breaks = 6, col = '#5867ab', border = 'white', main = 'How many Senate seats we expect each party to win', xlab = 'Values', ylab = 'Frequency')


```


## Blue Jay data
I love birds. If I could start over, I might choose to study bird behavior instead of human behavior. The plot below shows the relationship between head length and body mass for blue jays. 

```{r, out.width = '200px', retina = 1, fig.cap = "Head length versus body mass for 123 blue jays. The birds' sex is indicated by color, and the birds' skull size by symbol size. Head-length measurements include the length of the bill while skull-size measurements do not. Data source: Keith Tarvin, Oberlin College."}

  include_graphics('jaysgraph.png')

```

2. Use the `blue_jays.rda` data to replicate the plot in full, including the note describing the plot. The final output plot should be 4 inches wide and 3 inches tall.


```{r}

load(file='blue_jays.rda')

plot3 <- ggplot(blue_jays, aes(x = Mass, y = Head, color = KnownSex, size = factor(Skull))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("M" = "#005fa7", "F" = "#da3c00")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(52, 60),
    breaks = c(52, 54, 56, 58, 60)) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c("28" = 3, "30" = 4, "32" = 5, "34" = 6)) +
  labs(x = "body mass (g)", y = "head length (mm)", color = "sex", size = "skull size (mm)")
  theme_bw()
print(plot3)

```

```{r}
ggsave('birds.png', plot3, width = 4, height = 3
)
```
